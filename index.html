                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. Unfortunately, that's a level 10 compared to GPT-6, which is at a level 200. I saw an AGI deploy and entire 160,000 lines of nearly perfect front and back-end for a new site in 4 minutes flat. That's like a high school physics student going up against Von Neumann. We're cooked".</p>
